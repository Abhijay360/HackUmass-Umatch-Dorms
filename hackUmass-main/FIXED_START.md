The dependencies are now installed! Here's how to start everything:

## Step 1: Start the Backend

Open a **NEW terminal window** and run:

```bash
cd "/Users/abhijay/Downloads/hackUmass-main/backend"
python3 main.py
```

**You should see:**

## Step 2: Make Sure Frontend is Running

In your **other terminal** (where you ran `npm run dev`), make sure it's still running.

If not, run:
```bash
cd "/Users/abhijay/Downloads/hackUmass-main"
npm run dev
```
